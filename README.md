- **Emergency Contacts**: Users can set up a list of emergency contacts, including family members, friends, or authorities, ensuring that help is just a button press away.

- **Discreet Usage**: The SOS feature is designed for discreet use, allowing users to activate it without alerting potential threats.

- **Customizable Alerts**: Users can tailor the alert message to ensure that the emergency contacts receive relevant information.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app boasts an intuitive and user-friendly design, making it accessible and easy to use, even in stressful situations.

- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase serves as the backend, securely storing user data and facilitating real-time communication with emergency contacts.

- **Privacy and Security**: The app prioritizes user privacy and data security, ensuring that sensitive information is kept confidential.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The app is developed using Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language for Android applications.
